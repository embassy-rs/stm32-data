    description: This register is only writable if bits CCCR.CCE and CCCR.INIT are set. The CAN bit time may be programed in the range of 4 to 25 time quanta. The CAN time quantum may be programmed in the range of 1 to 1024 FDCAN clock periods. tq = (DBRP + 1) FDCAN clock period. DTSEG1 is the sum of Prop_Seg and Phase_Seg1. DTSEG2 is Phase_Seg2. Therefore the length of the bit time is (programmed values) [DTSEG1 + DTSEG2 + 3] tq or (functional values) [Sync_Seg + Prop_Seg + Phase_Seg1 + Phase_Seg2] tq. The Information Processing Time (IPT) is zero, meaning the data for the next bit is available at the first clock edge after the sample point.

    description: Write access to the Test Register has to be enabled by setting bit CCCR[TEST] to 1 . All Test Register functions are set to their reset values when bit CCCR[TEST] is reset. Loop Back mode and software control of Tx pin FDCANx_TX are hardware test modes. Programming TX differently from 00 may disturb the message transfer on the CAN bus.

    description: The RAM Watchdog monitors the READY output of the Message RAM. A Message RAM access starts the Message RAM Watchdog Counter with the value configured by the RWD[WDC] bits. The counter is reloaded with RWD[WDC] bits when the Message RAM signals successful completion by activating its READY output. In case there is no response from the Message RAM until the counter has counted down to 0, the counter stops and interrupt flag IR[WDI] bit is set. The RAM Watchdog Counter is clocked by the fdcan_pclk clock.

  description: Write access to the Test Register has to be enabled by setting bit CCCR[TEST] to 1 . All Test Register functions are set to their reset values when bit CCCR[TEST] is reset. Loop Back mode and software control of Tx pin FDCANx_TX are hardware test modes. Programming TX differently from 00 may disturb the message transfer on the CAN bus.
