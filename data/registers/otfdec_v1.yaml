When this bit is cleared (default), OTFDEC is used in decryption mode, during which application only read back decrypted data. For both modes, cryptographic context (keys, nonces, firmware versions) must be properly initialized. When this bit is set, only data accesses are allowed (zeros are returned otherwise, and XONEIF is set). When MODE = 11, enhanced encryption mode is automatically selected. Note: When ENC bit is set, no access to OCTOSPI must be done (registers and Memory‑mapped region).'

    description: Key error interrupt flag status This bit is set by hardware and read only by application. The bit is set when a read access occurs on an encrypted region, while its key registers is null or not properly initialized (KEYCRC = 0x0). This bit is cleared when the application sets in OTFDEC_ICR the corresponding bit to 1. After KEIF is set any subsequent read to the region with bad key registers returns a zeroed value. This state remains until those key registers are properly initialized (KEYCRC not zero).
