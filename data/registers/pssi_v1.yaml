    description: 'PSSI enable The contents of the FIFO are flushed when ENABLE is cleared to 0. Note: When ENABLE=1, the content of PSSI_CR must not be changed, except for the ENABLE bit itself. All configuration bits can change as soon as ENABLE changes from 0 to 1. The DMA controller and all PSSI configuration registers must be programmed correctly before setting the ENABLE bit to 1. The ENABLE bit and the DCMI ENABLE bit (bit 15 of DCMI_CR) must not be set to 1 at the same time.'
