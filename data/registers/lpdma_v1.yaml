The first memory burst read of a (possibly 2D/repeated) block, also named as the first ready FIFO-based source burst, is gated by the occurrence of both the hardware request and the first trigger hit. The LPDMA monitoring of a trigger for channel x is started when the channel is enabled/loaded with a new active trigger configuration: rising or falling edge on a selected trigger (TRIGPOL[1:0] = 01 or respectively TRIGPOL[1:0] = 10). The monitoring of this trigger is kept active during the triggered and uncompleted (data or link) transfer; and if a new trigger is detected then, this hit is internally memorized to grant the next transfer, as long as the defined rising or falling edge is not modified, and the TRIGSEL[5:0] is not modified, and the channel is enabled. Transferring a next LLIn+1 that updates the CH[x].TR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0], resets the monitoring, trashing the memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger.

This offset is not including and is added to the programmed burst size when the completed burst is addressed in incremented mode (CH[x].TR1.SINC = 1). Note: A source address offset must be aligned with the programmed data width of a source burst (SAO[2:0] versus CH[x].TR1.SDW_LOG2[1:0]).
