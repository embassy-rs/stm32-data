  - name: BRGEN
    description: Scaler bridge enable This bit is set and cleared by software (only if LOCK not set). This bit enables the bridge of the scaler. If SCALEN is set and BRGEN is reset, all four scaler outputs provide the same level V<sub>REF_COMP</sub> (similar to V<sub>REFINT</sub>). If SCALEN and BRGEN are set, the four scaler outputs provide V<sub>REF_COMP</sub>, 3/4-V<sub>REF_COMP</sub>, 1/2-V<sub>REF_COMP</sub> and 1/4-V<sub>REF_COMP</sub> levels, respectively.
