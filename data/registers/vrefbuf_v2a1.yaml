  - name: TRIM
    description: 'Trimming code The TRIM code is a 6-bit unsigned data (minimum 000000, maximum 111111) that is set and updated according the mechanism described below. Reset: TRIM[5:0] is automatically initialized with the VRS = 0 trimming value stored in the Flash memory during the production test. VRS change: TRIM[5:0] is automatically initialized with the trimming value (corresponding to VRS setting) stored in the Flash memory during the production test. Write in TRIM[5:0]: User can modify the TRIM[5:0] with an arbitrary value. This is permanently disabling the control of the trimming value with VRS (until the device is reset). Note: If the user application performs the trimming, the trimming code must start from 000000 to 111111 in ascending order.'
