    description: This register contains information about the FIFO status and interrupt.
      The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up
      to 16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI
      bus for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining
      its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of
      the FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written
      to the memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait
      until the FIFO is empty.

      same as the parity value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a
      page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR register should be

    description: This register sets the refresh rate in number of SDCLK clock cycles
      between the refresh cycles by configuring the Refresh Timer Count value.Examplewhere
      64 ms is the SDRAM refresh period.The refresh rate must be increased by 20 SDRAM
      clock cycles (as in the above example) to obtain a safe margin if an internal
      refresh request occurs when a read request has been accepted. It corresponds
      to a COUNT value of 0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a
      timer which is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh
      pulse when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to 41 SDRAM
      clock cycles.As soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is programmed, the timer starts
      counting. If the value programmed in the register is 0, no refresh is carried
      out. This register must not be reprogrammed after the initialization procedure
      to avoid modifying the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated,
      this 13-bit COUNT field is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in
      progress, the Auto-refresh request is delayed. However, if the memory access
      and Auto-refresh requests are generated simultaneously, the Auto-refresh takes
      precedence. If the memory access occurs during a refresh operation, the request
      is buffered to be processed when the refresh is complete.This register is common
      to SDRAM bank 1 and bank 2.

    description: 'Bus turnaround phase duration These bits are written by software
      to add a delay at the end of a write-to-read or read-to write transaction. The
      programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between an asynchronous read (in
      muxed or mode D) or write transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous
      read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation is performed, the bank
      can be the same or a different one, whereas it must be different in case of
      write operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode D. In some cases,
      whatever the programmed BUSTRUN values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as
      follows: The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two consecutive asynchronous
      write transfers to the same static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode
      D. There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive
      asynchronous read transfers to the same static memory bank except for modes
      muxed and D. An asynchronous read to an asynchronous or synchronous write to
      any static bank or dynamic bank except in modes muxed and D mode. There is a
      bus turnaround delay of 2 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive synchronous
      write operations (in Burst or Single mode) to the same bank. A synchronous write

      read operation. Two consecutive synchronous read operations (in Burst or Single

fieldset/SDRTR:
  description: This register sets the refresh rate in number of SDCLK clock cycles
    between the refresh cycles by configuring the Refresh Timer Count value.Examplewhere
    64 ms is the SDRAM refresh period.The refresh rate must be increased by 20 SDRAM
    clock cycles (as in the above example) to obtain a safe margin if an internal
    refresh request occurs when a read request has been accepted. It corresponds to
    a COUNT value of 0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a timer
    which is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh pulse
    when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to 41 SDRAM clock cycles.As
    soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is programmed, the timer starts counting. If the
    value programmed in the register is 0, no refresh is carried out. This register
    must not be reprogrammed after the initialization procedure to avoid modifying
    the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated, this 13-bit COUNT field
    is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in progress, the Auto-refresh
    request is delayed. However, if the memory access and Auto-refresh requests are
    generated simultaneously, the Auto-refresh takes precedence. If the memory access
    occurs during a refresh operation, the request is buffered to be processed when
    the refresh is complete.This register is common to SDRAM bank 1 and bank 2.

fieldset/SR:
  description: This register contains information about the FIFO status and interrupt.
    The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up to
    16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI bus
    for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining
    its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of the
    FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written to the
    memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait until the
    FIFO is empty.
