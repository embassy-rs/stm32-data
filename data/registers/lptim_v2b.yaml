This bit can be set only when the LPTIM is enabled. It is automatically reset by hardware. COUNTRST must never be set to '1' by software before it is already cleared to '0' by hardware. Software should consequently check that COUNTRST bit is already cleared to '0' before attempting to set it to '1'.
