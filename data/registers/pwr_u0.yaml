  - name: SBF
    description: Standby flag This bit is set by hardware when the device enters the Standby mode and is cleared by setting the CSBF bit in the PWR_SCR register, or by a power-on reset. It is not cleared by the system reset.

    description: 'Flash ready flag This bit is set by hardware to indicate when the flash memory is readey to be accessed after wake-up from power-down. To place the flash memory in power-down, set either FPD_LPRUN, FPD_LPSLP or FPD_STP bits. Note : If the system boots from SRAM, the user application must wait until the FLASH_RDY bit is set, prior to jumping to flash memory.'

    description: Low-power regulator started This bit provides the information whether the low-power regulator is ready after a power-on reset or a Standby/Shutdown. If the Standby mode is entered while REGLPS bit is still cleared, the wake-up from Standby mode time may be increased.

    description: Low-power regulator flag This bit is set by hardware when the MCU is in Low-power run mode. When the MCU exits from the Low-power run mode, this bit remains at 1 until the regulator is ready in main mode. A polling on this bit must be done before increasing the product frequency. This bit is cleared by hardware when the regulator is ready.

    description: Voltage scaling flag A delay is required for the internal regulator to be ready after the voltage scaling has been changed. VOSF indicates that the regulator reached the voltage level defined with VOS bits of the PWR_CR1 register.
