Hardware sets the STRX bits to NAK when a correct transfer has occurred (VTRX=1) corresponding to a OUT or SETUP (control only) transaction addressed to this endpoint, so the software has the time to elaborate the received data before it acknowledge a new transaction Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which control the status based upon buffer availability condition (Refer to endpoints).

These bits are read/write but they can be only toggled by writing '1. Host mode These bits are the host application controls to start, retry, or abort host transactions driven by the channel. These bits also contain information about the device answer to the last IN channel transaction and report the current status of the channel according to the following STRX table of states: -\tDISABLE DISABLE value is reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a single-buffer channel. When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the Host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it will be regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated. -\tVALID An Host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the Host Frame Schedure to submit its configured transaction. VALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel will be re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled. - NAK NAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE - STALL STALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received. When in STALL state the channel behaves as disabled. Application should not retry transmission but reset the USB and re-enumerate."

      description: "Direction of transaction This bit is written by the hardware according to the direction of the successful transaction, which generated the interrupt request. If DIR bit=0, VTTX bit is set in the USB_EPnR register related to the interrupting endpoint. The interrupting transaction is of IN type (data transmitted by the USB peripheral to the host PC). If DIR bit=1, VTRX bit or both VTTX/VTRX are set in the USB_EPnR register related to the interrupting endpoint. The interrupting transaction is of OUT type (data received by the USB peripheral from the host PC) or two pending transactions are waiting to be processed. This information can be used by the application software to access the USB_EPnR bits related to the triggering transaction since it represents the direction having the interrupt pending. This bit is read-only."

      description: "Expected start of frame This bit is set by the hardware when an SOF packet is expected but not received. The host sends an SOF packet each 1Â ms, but if the device does not receive it properly, the Suspend Timer issues this interrupt. If three consecutive ESOF interrupts are generated (i.e. three SOF packets are lost) without any traffic occurring in between, a SUSP interrupt is generated. This bit is set even when the missing SOF packets occur while the Suspend Timer is not yet locked. This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."

      description: "Start of frame This bit signals the beginning of a new USB frame and it is set when a SOF packet arrives through the USB bus. The interrupt service routine may monitor the SOF events to have a 1Â ms synchronization event to the USB host and to safely read the USB_FNR register which is updated at the SOF packet reception (this could be useful for isochronous applications). This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."

      description: USB reset request Device mode This bit is set by hardware when an USB reset is released by the host and the bus returns to idle. USB reset state is internally detected after the sampling of 60 consecutive SE0 cycles. Host mode This bit is set by hardware when device connection or device disconnection is detected. Device connection is signaled after J state is sampled for 22cycles consecutively from unconnected state. Device disconnection is signaled after SE0 state is sampled for 22cycles consecutively from connected state.

This event asynchronously clears the LP_MODE bit in the CTLR register and activates the USB_WAKEUP line, which can be used to notify the rest of the device (e.g. wakeup unit) about the start of the resume process. This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."

      description: "Error This flag is set whenever one of the errors listed below has occurred: NANS:\tNo ANSwer. The timeout for a host response has expired. CRC:\tCyclic Redundancy Check error. One of the received CRCs, either in the token or in the data, was wrong. BST:\tBit Stuffing error. A bit stuffing error was detected anywhere in the PID, data, and/or CRC. FVIO:\tFraming format Violation. A non-standard frame was received (EOP not in the right place, wrong token sequence, etc.). The USB software can usually ignore errors, since the USB peripheral and the PC host manage retransmission in case of errors in a fully transparent way. This interrupt can be useful during the software development phase, or to monitor the quality of transmission over the USB bus, to flag possible problems to the user (e.g. loose connector, too noisy environment, broken conductor in the USB cable and so on). This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."

    - name: PMAOVR
      description: "Packet memory area over / underrun This bit is set if the microcontroller has not been able to respond in time to an USB memory request. The USB peripheral handles this event in the following way: During reception an ACK handshake packet is not sent, during transmission a bit-stuff error is forced on the transmitted stream; in both cases the host will retry the transaction. The PMAOVR interrupt should never occur during normal operations. Since the failed transaction is retried by the host, the application software has the chance to speed-up device operations during this interrupt handling, to be ready for the next transaction retry; however this does not happen during Isochronous transfers (no isochronous transaction is anyway retried) leading to a loss of data in this case. This bit is read/write but only '0 can be written and writing '1 has no effect."
