Each bit, when set, enables the CEC logical address identified by the given bit position. At the end of HEADER reception, the received destination address is compared with the enabled addresses. In case of matching address, the incoming message is acknowledged and received. In case of non-matching address, the incoming message is received only in listen mode (LSTN=1), but without acknowledge sent. Broadcast messages are always received. Example: OAR = 0b000 0000 0010 0001 means that CEC acknowledges addresses 0x0 and 0x5. Consequently, each message directed to one of these addresses is received.'

    description: 'Tx Start Of Message TXSOM is set by software to command transmission of the first byte of a CEC message. If the CEC message consists of only one byte, TXEOM must be set before of TXSOM. Start-Bit is effectively started on the CEC line after SFT is counted. If TXSOM is set while a message reception is ongoing, transmission will start after the end of reception. TXSOM is cleared by hardware after the last byte of the message is sent with a positive acknowledge (TXEND=1), in case of transmission underrun (TXUDR=1), negative acknowledge (TXACKE=1), and transmission error (TXERR=1). It is also cleared by CECEN=0. It is not cleared and transmission is automatically retried in case of arbitration lost (ARBLST=1). TXSOM can be also used as a status bit informing application whether any transmission request is pending or under execution. The application can abort a transmission request at any time by clearing the CECEN bit. Note: TXSOM must be set when CECEN=1 TXSOM must be set when transmission data is available into TXDR HEADERs first four bits containing own peripheral address are taken from TXDR[7:4], not from CEC_CFGR.OAR which is used only for reception.'
