Hence, when a decryption is selected in Wrapped-key mode read-as-zero SAES_DOUT register is automatically loaded into SAES key registers after a successful decryption process.

At the end of the decryption process, if KMOD[1:0] is other than zero, KEYSEL[2:0] is cleared. With the bitfield value other than zero and KEYVALID set, the application cannot transfer the ownership of SAES with a loaded key to an application running in another security context (such as secure, non-secure). More specifically, when security of an access to any register does not match the information recorded by SAES, the KEIF flag is set.

In normal mode when KEYSEL equals to zero, the application must write the key registers in the correct sequence, otherwise the KEIF flag of the SAES_ISR register is set and KEYVALID stays at zero. When KEYSEL is different from zero the BUSY flag is automatically set by SAES. When key is loaded successfully, the BUSY flag is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, the KEIF flag of the SAES_ISR register is set, the BUSY flag cleared and KEYVALID kept at zero. When the KEIF flag is set, the application must clear it through the SAES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF bit description for more details.
